# Configuration file consists of mandatory 'Global' block that MUST come first,
# and optionally one or more 'Plugin' block.
# Lines having '#' as first non-blank char or blank lines are ignored
# Value of variable is a text from first non-blank char after '=' 
# till the last non-blank char. '#' is NOT treated as coment in this context

# 'Global' block describes gloabal parameters like position, size and 
# some NETWM settings

# GLobal {

#     # screen edge  
#     # legal values are: left, right, top, bottom
#     edge = bottom

#     # allignment of a panel
#     # legal values are: left, right, center
#     allign = left

#     # length of margin (in pixels) 
#     # legal values are numbers
#     margin = 0

#     # widthtype specifies how panel width is calculated
#     # legal values are: request, pixel, percent
#     #   request - follow widgets' size requests. can shrink or grow dynamically
#     #   pixel   - ocupy fixed number of pixels, then 'width' variable holds a number
#     #   percent - be 'width' precent of an edge.
#     widthtype = percent

#     # numerical value of width (not applicable for 'request' widthtype)
#     # legal values are numbers
#     width = 80

#     # heighttype specifies how panel height is calculated
#     # legal values are: pixel
#     #   pixel   - ocupy fixed number of pixels, then 'height' variable holds a number
#     heighttype = pixel

#     # numerical value of height (if applicable)
#     # legal values are numbers
#     height = 28


#     # Identify panel window type as dock 
#     # legal values are boolean
#     SetDockTpe = true

#     # Reserve panel's space so that it will not be covered by maximazied windows
#     # legal values are boolean
#     # SetPartialStrut = true
# }



# 'Plugin' block specifies a plugin to load. It has same syntax for both
# builtin and external plugins.

# dclock      - digital clock

# expand - specifies if plugin can accomodate extra space or not [optional]
# padding - extra paddin around plugin  [optional]
# config {} - block of plugin's private configuration. 
#             This part is plugin  dependant


#  
# Plugin {
#     type = wincmd
#     config {
#         image = ~/.lxpanel/images/Desktop2.png
#         tooltip = Left click to iconify all windows. Middle click to shade them.
#     }
# }
