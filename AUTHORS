[History]
LXPanel is a derivative work from fbpanel [1] written by Anatoly Asviyan,
and fbpanel is derived from another project, fspanel [2], originally 
written by Peter Zelezny.

[Credits]
Fbpanel has done its good job, but it didn't satisfy our needs. Originally 
PCMan sent patches to the author of fbpanel, Anatoly Asviyan, and they had
some discussions.  After Asviyan received some patches, PCMan would be 
willing to enhance this little panel application which might be differnt 
from the goal of Anatoly in the future. However, PCMan didn'get enough 
chance to join fbpanel project. So, finally PCMan decided to create his own
branch, and started the hacking regarding he want to do. Thank to Anatoly 
Asviyan and Peter Zelezny, the original creator for this little panel. And 
the most important, thank free software, which gives us the freedom to 
modify existing projects to serve our needs. :-)

* src/plugins/menu.c contains few pieces of code from menu.c of gnome-panel.

* gtk-builder-convert is a fixed version of the original program included in
  gtk+ package. It's originally developed by gtk+ developers, but it contains
  some bugs. So a fixed version is included here.
