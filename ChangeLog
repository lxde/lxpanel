0.10.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed delayed application of font cnahges on dclock and weather plugins.
* Allowed switching workplaces by scrolling over the pager.
* Added new API: lxpanel_draw_label_text_with_color().
* Fixed not-applicable font setting on thermal plugin.
* Fixed crash on right-click task button after some task was killed using menu
    on another task button.
* Fixed crash after color was removed from monitor plugin configuration.
* Aligned used memory calculation in lxpanel monitor with 'free' command line
    utility.
* Added possibility to use few weather providers for weather widget.
* Disabled Yahoo! Weather because they removed free API support.
* Added OpenWeatherMap weather provider.
* Fixed wrong application position on taskbar in multihead configuration.
* Fixed battery color (must be green) when battery is fully charged.
* Fixed crash at task plugin when all windows lose focus.
* Disambiguated keyboard layout names to follow variants.

0.9.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Finally fixed battery calculations, it missed Power so left time was
    always at zero.
* Fixed task window raising on drop file on it (was broken since 0.9.0).

0.9.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed battery selection if battery detached but another is available.
* Fixed battery percentage calculations if charge isn't available but
    energy is, it appears broken in 0.9.0.
* Fixed wrong state change on task button when hovered, it shouldn't
    receive selected state until window has urgency.
* Fixed wrong flat button appearance when hovered, it wasn't flat.

0.9.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed build failure without ALSA.
* Added alternative mixers if build using OSS.
* Fixed panel flicker with some window managers.

0.9.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Added support for laptops with multiple batteries.
* Added a way to scroll through workspaces by using the scroll wheel over
    the deskno plugin.
* Bunch of fixes for GTK+ 3.0 compatibility.
* Fixed outdated lxpanel man page.
* Fixed weather locations query (since YQL was changed recently).
* Converted space plugin into internal PanelSpace widget in liblxpanel.
* Converted task button into widget class to avoid ambiguous code.
* Added support for third-party plugins localized descriptions.
* Implemented "lxpanelctl command ..." to send message to panel plugin.
* Added APIs for PanelIconGrid to draw focus on drop.
* Converted launch button into widget class for more easy management.
* Adjusted PanelIconGrid: min spacing is now 1, no_window flag is now
    left unset by default, spacing is taken into account on overall size
    to be consistent on chosen orientation.
* Implemented dropping file or folder onto launch bar to create launcher.
* Implemented dragging launchers around launchbars (between panels too).
* Implemented dropping file or folder onto free panel space to create
    launcher.
* Implemented dragging launchers from launchbar to some free panel space.
    When launcher dropped onto another place and former place's launchbar
    becomes empty, it will not be replaced with a bootstrapping icon (as
    it happens when last launcher is removed via configuration dialog)
    but launchbar will be removed from the panel instead, that behavior
    is more obvious and sensible.
* Added stripping scheme from URI menu://applications/... when a launcher
    is created, only menu-id itself should be used.
* Implemented moving plugins across panel by means of middle button drag
    and drop, i.e. middle-click it then drag, and plugin will follow the
    mouse until middle button is released.
* Merged 'volume' and 'volumealsa' plugins into single plugin which uses
    the same interface but different driver, in dependency on how it was
    built - either OSS or ALSA interface is used. Name 'volume' is used
    for simplicity while 'volumealsa' is supported for compatibility.
* Made default channel in 'volume' plugin definable in config. If there
    is no config statement then plugin finds first usable one, the same
    as before.
* Made clicks for Toggle Mute, Show Slider and Open Mixer actions of the
    'volume' plugin configurable. Defaults are the same: left-click shows
    slider, middle-click toggles mute state.
* Added support for 'PCM' and 'Headphone' channels for OSS mixer.
* Added support for other (not default one) ALSA cards in 'volume' plugin
    via 'CardNumber' setting.
* Added hotkey support into 'volume' plugin to be able to use multimedia
    keys for volume changing directly by plugin.
* Fixed missing libkeybinder initialization (keybinding did not work).
* Fixed check for attempt to add a binding for the same hotkey which is
    already bound elsewhere.
* Added a configuration dialog to the 'volume' plugin with all the new
    settings available to choose and set, including preset of discovered
    mixers, with ability to type own command as well.
* Fixed crash on action on task window which was deleted while task menu
    is still opened.
* Fixed "dynamic" panel width allocation.
* Fixed PanelIconGrid allocation in rigth-to-left languages, it was wrong
    so some icons might be invisible or placed under other plugins.
* Removed call to gtk_widget_set_style() from volume slider to fix colors
    of current theme.
* Changed icon size handling on task bar - it may now maintain the same
    size as rest of icons. It may affect users who are used to have them
    smaller, it's why this feature was made configurable, corresponding
    config variable is UseSmallerIcons and default is 1 (old behavior).
* Changed volume slider popup behavior - it now hides when loses focus.
* Fixed invalid memory access in weather plugin.
* Fixed incorrect reporting units on "Feel" value in weather plugin. YQL
    always reports Fahrenheit degrees there.
* Added a safeguard on menu cache returning items with empty Exec line.
* Fixed maximizing windows using task bar, GDK functions not always work.
* Fixed wrong bind of preferences dialog to the panel, which resulted in
    other dialogs appear on the same workspace where preferences was.
* Expanded launch buttons active area to launchbar borders so if clicked
    even into desktop corner, it should activate button at that corner.
* Fixed few memory leaks in 'batt' plugin.
* Removed unwanted conversions with energy for charge in 'batt' plugin
    which will mess up tooltip indications, and may make rate/percentage
    calculations invalid.
* Replaced Xclimsg() with Xclimsgx() to be screen aware with X11 message.
* Added a workaround for WM like MWM which does not properly resize down
    widgets of panel kind. It still leaves artefacts but is better now.
* Added a workaround on GtkBox behavior which does not send allocation
    requests to children in some cases, so resizing of launchtaskbar on
    panel height change was broken.
* Fixed PanelIconGrid layout on vertical panels with more than 1 column.

0.8.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed crash in taskbar plugin after number of desktops was updated.
* Fixed incorrect panel geometry initialization.
* Fixed crash with invalid size of icon in _NET_WM_ICON property.
* Fixed memory leak on 'indicator' plugin destruction.
* Replaced old commands:
    - Use notify send instead of xmessage
    - Use nm-connection-editor instead of network-admin

0.8.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Improved OSS headers detection a bit.
* Fixed expand setting on plugins with default_expand when more than one
    is available on the same panel.
* Fixed icon for task button that retrieved using WM_HINTS.
* Fixed wrong PanelIconGrid arrangement in vertical panel orientation.
* Fixed missing handlers disconnect when destroying Task structure.
* Removed writing debug messages to file when 'indicator' plugin is in
    use - it will write all the debug there and that changes the behavior
    which was not intended really.
* Corrected background for 'indicator' plugin.
* Fixed update 'indicator' plugin on configuration changes.
* Fixed battery status: if discharge rate is 0 then it's charged.
* Fixed incorrect cycle in netproc_devicelist_clear() leading to crash on
    resume (after suspend).
* Fixed scanning for temperature sensors which failed with some kernels.
* Changed reconfiguring panel behavior: callbacks to plugins will be sent
    on idle, not immediately to avoid "stuck" spin button (and eventually
    even crash was possible).
* Fixed initial icon on 'volumealsa' to show real state instead of muted.
* Fixed 'dclock' updating that it will show time on start, not just on
    next second change. It would create impression it's slow otherwise.
* Fixed wrong task button activation on not processed drag of button.

0.8.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Added workaround for crash in gtk-run with old libmenu-cache.
* Core functions are separated into a private library to allow reliable
    linking of modules using -Wl,-z,defs.
* Added macro LXPANEL_CHECK_VERSION() for third party pluguns API check.
* Added CONF_TYPE_EXTERNAL support for lxpanel_generic_config_dlg().
* Implemented property "aspect-width" for PanelIconGrid to allow using
    non-square tray sockets.
* Added support for monitors "All" to span panel over all monitors (i.e.
    to allow pre-0.6.0 behavior).
* Implemented monitors hotplug support.
* Fixed popups positioning in multi-monitor environment.
* Fixed updating panel size if appropriate monitor changed its size or
    position.
* Implemented disabling for "Reserve space" button if another monitor
    lies beyond the edge so reservation will cover it. Also reservation
    will not be applied in such cases even if set in config manually.
* Some edge and monitors selections in panel configuration dialog may be
    insensitive now if appropriate edge and monitor combination is not
    available, to avoid panels stacking one over another.
* Fixed bug with hidden panel disappearing after resolution change.
* Add lxpanel_image_new_for_icon() API to replace another (obsolete) API
    _gtk_image_new_from_file_scaled().
* Added API panel_config_hotkey_button_new() to use as CONF_TYPE_EXTERNAL
    widget to allow configure global hotkeys for plugins functions.
* Added API lxpanel_apply_hotkey() as a convenient libkeybinder interface
    to use in modules that also use panel_config_hotkey_button_new(). Now
    LXPanel requires libkeybinder too.
* Added API panel_config_click_button_new() to configure mouse gestures
    and panel_config_click_parse() to parse its output.
* Added "icon-size-changed" signal to LXPanel which is emitted when icons
    size in configuration dialog was changed.
* Improved lxpanel_image_new_for_icon() API to follow panel icons size
    changes, not only theme changes. This way calls on lxpanel_image_*
    APIs on theme or panel changes may be eliminated, i.e. code becomes
    simpler.
* Added new lxpanel_image_change_icon() API for simplification reasons so
    other lxpanel_image_* APIs can be replaced completely.
* APIs lxpanel_button_set_icon() lxpanel_button_update_icon() now don't
    require setting icon size since created button already follows size
    from panel settings. Also it doesn't require refresh after the panel
    configuration change.
* Disabled scaling up small icons in the taskbar: scaled up icons look
    bad due to pixelization (patch from Anton Lobashev).
* When adding new panel, now correctly edges of monitor where popup was
    are tried before any other monitors.
* Correctly open 'netstat' plugin own menu on leftclick since rightclick
    should open panel context menu instead.
* System critical temperature level in 'thermal' plugin now is properly
    ignored if manual levels are active.
* Fixed click on 'menu' plugin, only image was clickable, not whole area.
* Added API panel_config_int_button_new() for generic plugin config spin
    button with custom range, not just generic 0...1000.
* Fixed wrong behavior with PanelIconGrid constrained width after child
    was removed: size wasn't always renegotiated correctly.
* Fixed range of space reservation in multi-monitor setup (reservation
    might cover another monitor).
* Numeric-only string will be saved now double-quoted to distinguish it
    from number in config.
* Implemented flashing on task with urgency in grouped task list menu.
* Disabled flashing on urgency hint if window has focus, most of window
    managers do the same on window decorations.
* Fixed border of 'batt' plugin, it should correctly use panel settings.
    Also 'Size' setting of it doesn't include border width.
* Allowed default alarmCommand on 'batt' plugin be translated.
* Implemented sorting plugins in Add plugin window in alphabetic order.
* Fixed font in the weather plugin to use panel settings.
* Added new API lxpanel_button_compose() for future usage by plugins.
* Added optional volumealsa plugin volume mapping from alsamixer (patch
    from Peter).
* Added new API lxpanel_button_set_label() to change label of button that
    was created using some lxpanel_button_*() API.
* Added "panel-font-changed" signal to LXPanel to be able follow settings
    change in font configuration of panel using lxpanel_button_*() API.
* Fixed nasty bug with autohidden panel after unhide appeared for short
    time somewhere at the screen.
* Fixed calendar and configuration windows blinking on their appearance.
* Fixed panel update when background image changed in configuration.
* Changed to use persistent background image for panel and Cairo. This
    way updating background should be faster, and also fixed background
    of plugins when image is used, both placement and alpha color.
* Urgent window is now always visible on the taskbar irrelevant of the
    desktop number on which it appears, because urgent window requires
    user attention (patch from Andy Balaam).
* Moved bit of code that is used out from src/bg.c and discarded src/bg.c
    from code used.
* Dropped setting members of Panel structure: workarea, wa_len, bg.
* Replaced GtkComboBoxEntry in netstatus plugin window with GtkComboBox.
* Simplified plugins background setting - they should never use any own
    background but either use one from panel or from theme (depending on
    panel configuration). This should improve performance.
* Don't update a whole panel background anymore after some plugin was
    resized, only update the plugin itself to improve performance.

0.7.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed unhiding panel if it becomes empty and height_when_hidden is 0.
* Fixed invalid X protocol word size: despite of stating it 32 bit, the X
    server uses unsigned long which is 64 bit on 64-bit architectures.
* Adapted to use libmenu-cache >= 1.0.0 - it could show empty folders in
    the desktop menu.
* Fixed crash in taskbar after visible task changed name then gone.
* Ensured panel background update after some plugin was resized.
* FileManager statement from old config should never be scanned again.
* Fixed positioning of new created panel, the edge was not saved.
* Eliminated hardcoded "xterm" in 'volumealsa' plugin - LibFM has enough
    means to call terminal when needed.
* Fixed crash if 'volumealsa' plugin initialization failed.

0.7.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed search for the gtkrc file.
* Fixed search path for configuration - it should be not compilation time
    path but paths using $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS.
* Fixed incorrect flag for 'launchbar' plugin which marks him expandable.
* Fixed dragging of task buttons.
* Corrected using $XDG_MENU_PREFIX to work the same way as libfm does.
* Fixed using font description, font in gtkrc file was ignored.
* Improved search for hw sensors in /sys/class/hwmon/ hierarchy.
* Improved check for critical temperatures in 'termal' plugin, now each
    individual hardware setting (if available) is also taken into
    consideration.
* Fixed parsing alias name in 'weather' plugin settings.
* Got rid of all individual plugins/*/Makefile - those rules more easily
    can be contained in the plugins/Makefile.am. Adding a simple plugin
    basically would mean to add three lines into that file instead of
    writing whole Makefile.am.
* Fixed invalid system config path search ("lxpanel" part was missing).
* Fixed incorrect requirements in the lxpanel.pc file.
* Fixed memory leak in the 'volumealsa' plugin.
* Now 'volumealsa' checks for 'MixerCommand' setting in the configuration
    before guessing it.
* Fixed color saving in the configuration.
* Fixed incomplete resources deallocation in 'volumealsa' plugin.
* Fixed make uninstall (it left plugins installed).
* Fixed monitor number set from GUI.
* Fixed hang on netstatus icon in auto-hidden panel.
* Fixed icon grid compilation with GTK+ < 2.20.
* Fixed compilation without menu-cache.
* Now man pages are included in the GIT and tarball, not just xml files.
* Fixed incorrect printf arguments in 'netstatus' plugin.

0.7.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* New plugin 'launchtaskbar' with combined functionality from 'launchbar'
    and 'taskbar'. For easy support codebase is merged instead of doing
    duplicates but appearance is still the same in dependency from mode
    chosen.
* Integrated with LibFM, all launching and application selection in the
    launchbar settings is done by LibFM now.
* New simpler plugins API implementation, using LibFM plugins loader. In
    new API some callbacks were simplified and some removed, see all the
    detailed descriptions in the file plugin.h.
* New plugins are GtkWidgets now, therefore there is no explicit destroy
    for them or their data, all will be handled implicitly.
* Changed config access with simple API similar to libconfig one.
* Using icon caching from LibFM.
* Applications properties in the menu are managed by LibFM API, no more
    calls to lxshortcut application.
* Setting for file manager is not handled on its own but XDG setting is
    used now, i.e. default choice for "inode/directory" MIME type.
* Setting for terminal is handled by LibFM, therefore it is the same as
    in PCManFM now, no own setting anymore.
* Replaced configure option --enable-cast-checks with --enable-debug.
* Replaced 'pager' plugin with former 'wnckpager' one. The 'wnckpager'
    name is still supported for compatibility but it is the same plugin.
* Added new plugin 'weather', written by Piotr Sipika.
* Using drag & drop handling from LibFM in launchbar. It is possible now
    to use any kind of files as launchbuttons, and folders can receive
    drops as well.
* Allowed drag applications from system menu plugin so they now can be
    dropped somewhere. The obvious example is drop on the desktop.
* Using human readable sensor names if available (like 'Core 0', etc.).
* Panel is allowed to hide completely (setting width when hidden to 0).
* The IconGrid converted into GtkContainer derived class PanelIconGrid.
* Allowed to use <USER_CONFIG_DIR>/lxpanel/<profile>/gtkrc for the panel
    custom style setup.
* The panel itself in not a struct now but a GtkWindow derived class so
    no special API to destroy it is required.
* Improved the layout of icons in panel, they will not align to the edge
    of screen but appropriately to panel height. Some of them did that
    already but some were aligned to the screen edge without any gap.
* The button to configure plugin in panel plugins configuration tab is
    renamed from 'Edit' to 'Properties'.
* All logging is unified. The option --log is deprecated and isn't used
    anymore. User can change logs appearance using G_MESSAGES_DEBUG and
    G_MESSAGES_PREFIXED environment variables (see GLib docs).
* Old APIs are in place still for backward compatibility with third party
    plugins but will be dropped later, supposedly on next feature release
    point. Old APIs are not present in public headers, compatibility is
    on binary level only.
* A whole lot of bugfixes.
